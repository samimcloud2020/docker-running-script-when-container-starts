1 image, you can run many containers.

running script , after container starts by      ENTRYPOINT[" "]


WHEN USE entrypoint?
when container starts you initialize your database like postgressql.

situation:
for each project you write seperate Dockerfile.

but official postgressql image, own having ENTRYPOINT. so resolved of writing Dockerfile with ENTRYPOINT for each project.



you in script in when container starts:-----
need to initialize db.
need to specify env variable.
complicated logic.


default ENTRYPOINT IS  /bin/sh -c 


but CMD INSTRUCTION IS:
/bin/sh -c "flask .............."

ENTRYPOINT:
let u run custom script.

ENTRYPOINT TO EXECUTE CUSTOM SCRIPT:
FOR NEED OF DB MIGRATION.
TO CHANGE CONFIG FILE LIKE NGINX ETC.
